# 🤖 AI & ML Models Collection

This repository is a collection of various **AI & Machine Learning projects** I’ve worked on, covering topics like classification, regression, clustering, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and deployment with Flask/Streamlit.  

Each project is self-contained and demonstrates a different ML workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment.
