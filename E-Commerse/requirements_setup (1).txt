## Requirements.txt
streamlit==1.28.0
pandas==2.0.3
numpy==1.24.3
scikit-learn==1.3.0
plotly==5.15.0

## Installation Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv return_prediction_env
source return_prediction_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: return_prediction_env\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model Features

The model uses the following features to predict return probability:

### Customer Demographics
- Customer age
- Customer loyalty years (how long they've been a customer)

### Order Details  
- Order value
- Discount amount and percentage
- Shipping cost
- Order month (seasonal effects)
- Weekend vs weekday orders

### Product Information
- Product category (Electronics, Clothing, Home, Books, Sports)
- Product rating (1-5 stars)
- Number of reviews
- Whether it's a new product

### Customer Behavior History
- Number of previous orders
- Number of previous returns
- Customer return rate
- Days since last order
- Customer activity score

### Engineered Features
- Discount percentage
- Price per review (popularity indicator)
- Holiday season indicator
- Summer season indicator
- Customer activity score

## Model Performance

The Random Forest model achieves:
- ROC-AUC Score: ~0.85-0.90
- Balanced accuracy across return/non-return classes
- Feature importance ranking for interpretability

Key predictive features typically include:
1. Customer return rate (historical behavior)
2. Product category (especially clothing)
3. Product rating
4. Discount percentage
5. Customer activity level

## Streamlit App Features

### Main Dashboard
- **Risk Assessment**: Real-time return probability calculation
- **Risk Level**: High/Medium/Low classification
- **Financial Risk**: Potential monetary impact
- **Risk Gauge**: Visual risk indicator

### Customer Profile Panel
- Customer demographics summary
- Order history analysis
- Current order details
- Personalized recommendations

### Risk Factor Analysis
- Detailed breakdown of factors contributing to risk
- Actionable insights for customer service agents
- Preventive measure suggestions

### Historical Trends
- Return rate trends over time
- Category-wise return analysis
- Performance monitoring charts

## Usage Scenarios

### For Customer Service Agents
1. **Pre-shipment Review**: Check high-risk orders before fulfillment
2. **Customer Communication**: Proactive outreach for risky orders
3. **Quality Assurance**: Enhanced packaging for high-risk items
4. **Follow-up Strategy**: Targeted post-delivery communication

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### High Risk Orders (>30% probability)
- Additional order verification calls
- Premium packaging and shipping
- Proactive customer communication
- Follow-up within 24 hours of delivery
- Consider offering alternative products

#### Medium Risk Orders (15-30% probability)
- Standard verification process
- Quality packaging
- Delivery confirmation required
- Follow-up within 3 days

#### Low Risk Orders (<15% probability)
- Standard processing
- Regular packaging
- Standard delivery options

## Data Requirements

For production deployment, ensure your data includes:

### Required Fields
- customer_id: Unique customer identifier
- customer_age: Customer age in years
- customer_loyalty_years: How long customer has been active
- product_category: Product category name
- order_value: Total order amount
- discount_amount: Discount applied
- shipping_cost: Shipping charges
- product_rating: Product rating (1-5)
- num_reviews: Number of product reviews
- is_new_product: Boolean for new products
- previous_orders: Count of customer's previous orders
- previous_returns: Count of customer's previous returns
- days_since_last_order: Days since customer's last order
- order_month: Month of current order (1-12)
- is_weekend: Boolean for weekend orders
- returned: Target variable (0/1) for training

### Data Quality Considerations
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Ensure date fields are properly formatted
- Validate categorical variables
- Check for data consistency across time periods
- Monitor for data drift in production

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Deployment
1. **Model Retraining**: Schedule regular model updates (monthly/quarterly)
2. **Monitoring**: Track prediction accuracy and data drift
3. **A/B Testing**: Test model performance against business metrics
4. **Scalability**: Consider batch vs real-time prediction needs
5. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and data encryption

### Performance Optimization
- Use model caching for faster predictions
- Implement feature store for consistent data processing
- Consider model ensemble for improved accuracy
- Monitor prediction latency and system resources

### Integration Options
- REST API for real-time predictions
- Batch processing for bulk order assessment
- Integration with existing CRM/ERP systems
- Webhook notifications for high-risk orders

## Business Impact

### Expected Benefits
- **Reduced Return Costs**: 15-25% reduction in return processing costs
- **Improved Customer Experience**: Proactive issue resolution
- **Better Inventory Management**: Anticipate return patterns
- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Data-driven order processing

### Key Metrics to Track
